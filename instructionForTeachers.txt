I am submitting "myawesomerepo" on Gradescope. There is an additional branch in this repo that is not visible so here is the link:
 * https://github.com/iumi04/myawesomerepo

As for this assignment, I have completed all steps (0-5). The steps for 0-3 are visible in this attached repository "myawesomerepo".
Steps 4-5 required a repository to be forked and I have completed those steps in this repository here:
 * https://github.com/iumi04/intern-bootcamp-git

I have also created a pull request (as instructed in step 5) and it is displayed under "Open" (pull requests) under umending/intern-bootcamp-git.
